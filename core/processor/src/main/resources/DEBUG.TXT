In ReceiveMessage must be an option to retrieve that.

MessageAttributeName.member.N
The name of the message attribute, where N is the index. The message attribute name can contain the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), hyphen (-), and period (.). The name must not start or end with a period, and it should not have successive periods. The name is case sensitive and must be unique among all attribute names for the message. The name can be up to 256 characters long. The name cannot start with "AWS." or "Amazon." (or any variations in casing), because these prefixes are reserved for use by Amazon Web Services.

When using ReceiveMessage, you can send a list of attribute names to receive, or you can return all of the attributes by specifying "All" or ".*" in your request. You can also use "foo.*" to return all message attributes starting with the "foo" prefix.

Type: String list
